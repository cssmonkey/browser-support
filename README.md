Blurb on browser &amp; platform support

# Browser Support


The web is much more versatile than ever before, we can access the internet through dozens of devices in many different ways:e.g.  for the Samsung Galaxy there are at least 2 different versions of operating systems for this devices and 3 or more browsers available. With the option to rotate the device, viewing both horizontally and vertically this makes at least 12 possible variations in which users can view a website. Take this number and multiply it by the number of widely available most used smartphone and tablet devices and you can easily reach more than a hundred variations. This, in addition to the traditional desktop environment, makes it impossible to test all variations with each code release.

At Equator we aim to build our websites using best practices by following the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standards and guidelines. The most commonly used browser rendering engines are also built with web standards in mind, this ensures our sites will render the same across a number of browsers which use the same rendering engine. Browser rendering engines are foundations of each browser and are responsible for the way sites render. The most popular web browsers are built on 3 main engines: Trident (IE), Gecko (Firefox) and Webkit (Safari, Chrome). So in most cases, if a website looks OK on Chrome it will also render nicely on Safari. 

### Key Points:
- We support the most commonly used browsers and operating systems.
- Our sites are built based on web standards (web standards provide the foundation of the internet, providing a consistent way to write web pages cross browser)
Many browsers share the same rendering engine

With the advent of Progressive Enhancement and Responsive Design, we focus less on making the sites look identical cross-browser; the emphasis is now on ensuring site works in accordance to browser capabilities. For example a site viewed in IE8 may function and look different to the same site viewed in IE9. This best practice, web standards approach means we can focus more on using the latest technologies to ensure our websites are future proof rather than wasting time supporting dated browsers with diminishing/low usage.

### Key Points:
- Browser testing no longer means attempting to make a website look the same in browsers of different capabilities or on devices with different size screens. It does mean ensuring that a personâ€™s experience of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities of a browser or device.

### Our current testing list includes:
- IE 7(limited support/simplified design & reduced functionality)
- IE 8,9,10
- Firefox Latest build
- Chrome Latest build
- Safari latest on Mac. Safari is no longer available on Windows.

### We browser test on the following Operating Systems:
- windows
- Mac OS
- iOS
- Android
